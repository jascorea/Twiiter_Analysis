# Twitter_Analysis

Objective:
This activity deals with text analysis of data pulled from twitter.Using this data, we answer a few important questions that helps us to get better insight into the collected data and derive meaning from it.

                   
How does the program work?


The program returns a collection of relevant Tweets matching a specified query. It makes use of the tweepy package which calls the Twitter API with the API keys as input. For retrieving the keys it asks for a search string and the time interval in which we want to extract particular number of tweets. The data returned is in JSON format. It may looks too much for now; it will become clearer in the next step how to read and process this data. 
                   
How do you think you can use this code?


Twitter data constitutes a rich source that can be used for capturing information about any topic imaginable. This data can be used in different use cases such as finding trends related to a specific keyword, measuring brand sentiment, and gathering feedback about new products and services.
              
Can you think of different scenarios where this code could be used for data collection?


It can be used for audience segmentation. Most marketing automation platforms (like Marketo, Eloqua, and Pardot) will allow you to place your audiences into different “buckets” using basic parameters like geography, language preference, and business unit, where each audience member receives content relevant to their segment. So someone living in the US will receive different content to someone living in Europe. To take it a step further, you can use social data to segment audiences based on their social media behavior, such as the content topics or social networks that they’re most engaging with. For example, if audiences are frequently clicking on posts about Subject A, you can strategically place them in a bucket where they will be served more content on Subject A.




How to run the programs?


I have written a python script to perform the assignment challenge. First I generate the list of tweets talking about cricket by executing the Twitter_File_Downloaded.py which generates cricket.txt.
To analysis this text file, Twitter_Assignment.py script is created. Executing this file will generate the required files asked in the challenge.
